## Challenge Question

As a solutions architect, the task is to design a three-tier architecture for a company currently operating with a one-tier architecture. The goal is to upgrade the infrastructure to be highly available, reliable, cost-effective, and secure.

## Architecture Objectives

1. **High Availability:** The architecture must ensure that the services are accessible with minimal downtime.

2. **Reliability:** The system should consistently perform its intended functions without failure.

3. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Optimize resource usage to minimize costs while meeting performance requirements.

4. **Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure a secure environment.

## Three-Tier Architecture Design

The proposed three-tier architecture consists of three main layers:

1. **Presentation Layer:**
   - This layer handles user interface and user interaction.
   - Components: Web Browsers, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), Load Balancers.

2. **Application Layer:**
   - Manages application logic and business processes.
   - Components: Application Servers, Load Balancers.

3. **Data Layer:**
   - Stores and manages data used by the application.
   - Components: Databases, Database Servers.

### Architecture Diagram

The architecture diagram clearly illustrates the relationships and interactions between the different layers. Components such as load balancers distribute traffic across multiple servers to ensure load distribution and fault tolerance.

## Components and Their Roles

1. **Load Balancers:**
   - Distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
   - Facilitate scalability and fault tolerance.

2. **Web Servers:**
   - Serve static content and handle initial user requests.
   - Communicate with the application servers to process dynamic content.

3. **Application Servers:**
   - Execute application logic and process dynamic content.
   - Interact with the data layer to retrieve or store information.

4. **Databases:**
   - Store and manage structured data.
   - Ensure data integrity and security.
